* rollout policy prioritize near-center cells
* limits number of nodes instead of number of rollouts
* pretrained mcts tree and save pretrained tree
* checks endgame state from center to outside for better performance (maybe unneccessary because current board-checking function is extremely fast)
* add pre-condition: min(m, n) >= k, k >= 3...
* use bitboards with np.uint16 (check maximum board size 16x16)
