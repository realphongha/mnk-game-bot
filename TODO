* rollout policy prioritize near-center cells
* limits number of nodes instead of number of rollouts
* pretrained mcts tree and save pretrained tree
* checks endgame state from center to outside for better performance (maybe unneccessary because current board-checking function is extremely fast)
* calculates tree when opponent playing
* smart policy: block when detects 3 in a line
