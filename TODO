* rollout policy prioritize near-center cells
* count nodes instead of rollout_total to avoid duplicate nodes counted
* pretrained mcts tree and save pretrained tree
* checks endgame state from center to outside for better performance (maybe unneccessary because current board-checking function is extremely fast)
* more cython optimization...
